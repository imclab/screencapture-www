Everybody loves at least two things:

* The `Command` + `Shift` + `4` shortcut for easily making screenshots in OS X.
* The world wide web

# Installation

1. `sudo mv /usr/sbin/screencapture /usr/sbin/screencapture-bin`
2. `curl https://raw.github.com/borismus/screencapture-www/master/screencapture > /usr/sbin/screencapture`
